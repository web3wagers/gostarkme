# Contributor Guidelines

üéâ Thank you for being interested in contributing to the Gostarkme project! üéâ

Feel welcome and read the following sections in order to know how to ask questions and how to work on something.

Please make sure you are welcoming and friendly in all of our spaces.

We're really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition. üëè

## Issues

The best way to contribute to our projects is by opening a new issue <a href="https://github.com/web3wagers/gostarkme/issues/new" target="_blank">Here</a> or tackling one of the issues <a href="https://github.com/web3wagers/gostarkme/issues" target="_blank">listed here</a> .

# Pull Requests

1. When picking up an issue give a brief presentation about yourself.

```
Template:
Hi, I'm [Your Name] and I'll be working on issue #[Issue Number].

I estimate this will take [Time Estimate] to complete.

```

2. **Estimated Time to Completion**: Approximate number of hours or days required to complete the task.

3. **Approach and Methodology**: Briefly outline your strategy for tackling the issue, including any relevant tools, technologies, or resources you plan to utilize

4. Fork the repo and create a new branch for your issue in the forked repo learn more about how to fork a repository<a href="https://github.com/web3wagers/gostarkme/issues" target="_blank"> here</a>

5. When modifying contracts kindly make sure the formatting is correct and all tests pass successfully.

6. Commit your changes.

7. Push to your fork and submit a pull request on our `dev` branch. Please provide us with some explanation of why you made the changes you made. For new features make sure to explain a standard use case to us.

## CI (Github Actions)

We use GitHub Actions to verify if the code of your PR passes all our checks.

When you submit your PR (or later change that code), a CI build will automatically be kicked off. A note will be added to the PR, and will indicate the current status of the build.

## Commits

We use Conventional Commits to add human and machine readable meaning to our commit messages. In particular, we use the Angular convention.

Don't worry if it looks complicated. In our repositories, after adding your files with git (i.e `git add`), you can just run the `commit` script in our `package.json`, and you'll be prompted to fill out any required commit fields at commit time. We use Commitizen under the hood.

Each commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer. The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope and a subject:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.

## Type

The type must be one of the following:

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature (improvements of the code structure)
- perf: A code change that improves the performance
- test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, npm)
- ci: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: travis, circle)
- chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- revert: Reverts a previous commit

### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. In a monorepo, it could be the name of the package or project affected.

### Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
Don't capitalize the first letter.
No dot (.) at the end.
Body
Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behaviour.

### Body

Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behaviour.

## Branches

1. There must be a `main` branch, used only for the releases.
2. There must be a `dev` branch, used to merge all the branches under it.
3. Avoid long descriptive names for long-lived branches.
4. Use kebab-case (no CamelCase).
5. Use grouping tokens (words) at the beginning of your branch names (in a similar way to the `type` of commit).
6. Define and use short lead tokens to differentiate branches in a way that is meaningful to your workflow.
7. Use slashes to separate parts of your branch names.
8. Remove your branch after merging it if it is not important.

Examples:

```
git branch -b docs/readme
git branch -b test/a-feature
git branch -b feat/sidebar
git branch -b fix/b-feature
```
