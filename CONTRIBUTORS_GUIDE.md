## Issues

The best way to contribute to our projects is by opening a new issue <a href="https://github.com/web3wagers/gostarkme/issues/new" target="_blank">Here</a> or tackling one of the issues <a href="https://github.com/web3wagers/gostarkme/issues" target="_blank">listed here</a> .

# Pull Requests

When assigned, please fork the repo and create a new branch to develop your issue. Once finished, open a PR and it will be reviewed by a mantainer ASAP.

1. When picking up an issue give a brief presentation about yourself.

```
Template:
Hi, I'm [Your Name] and I'll be working on issue #[Issue Number].

I estimate this will take [Time Estimate] to complete.

This is how I would tackle this issue:
[Steps to solve issue]

```

2. **Estimated Time to Completion**: Approximate number of hours or days required to complete the task.

3. **Approach and Methodology**: Briefly outline your strategy for tackling the issue, including any relevant tools, technologies, or resources you plan to utilize

4. Fork the repo and create a new branch for your issue in the forked repo learn more about how to fork a repository<a href="https://github.com/web3wagers/gostarkme/issues" target="_blank"> here</a>

5. When modifying contracts kindly make sure the formatting is correct and all tests pass successfully.

6. Commit your changes.

7. Push to your fork and submit a pull request on our `dev` branch. Please provide us with some explanation of why you made the changes you made. For new features make sure to explain a standard use case to us.

## CI (GitHub Actions)

We use GitHub Actions to verify if the code of your PR passes all our checks.

When you submit your PR (or later change that code), a CI build will automatically be kicked off. A note will be added to the PR, and will indicate the current status of the build.

## Commits

You can do a regular commit by following the next:

``` [type] significant message ```

### Type

The type must be one of the following:

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature (improvements of the code structure)
- perf: A code change that improves the performance
- test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, npm)
- ci: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: travis, circle)
- chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- revert: Reverts a previous commit

## Branches

1. There must be a `main` branch, used only for the releases.
2. There must be a `dev` branch, used to merge all the branches under it.
3. Avoid long descriptive names for long-lived branches.
4. Use kebab-case (no CamelCase).
5. Use grouping tokens (words) at the beginning of your branch names (in a similar way to the `type` of commit).
6. Define and use short lead tokens to differentiate branches in a way that is meaningful to your workflow.
7. Use slashes to separate parts of your branch names.
8. Remove your branch after merging it if it is not important.

Examples:

```
git branch -b docs/readme
git branch -b test/a-feature
git branch -b feat/sidebar
git branch -b fix/b-feature
```
